            <p>
              The COVID-19 outbreak is causing extraordinary disruption for companies
              and non-profits across the Garden State.
              The NJEDA wants to make it easy for organizations to understand what support
              programs are available to you to help stabilize your operations and
              get back on a pathway to growth.
            </p>
            <p>
              This is a beta version of the Eligibility Wizard that focuses on newly announced State Emergency
              Assistance
              programs and the SBA disaster loan program. We will be updating it regularly as new federal, state, local,
              and philanthropic programs become available.

              <strong>NJEDA Disclaimer for Organization Support Eligibility Wizard</strong>
              <p>
                As a courtesy, the NJEDA is offering this screening tool (the “Eligibility Wizard”)
                that lists emergency assistance programs that you may decide to consider based
                upon information you provide about your organization.
              </p>
              <p>
                To apply for a program, you need to apply through the appropriate administering
                agency. The Eligibility Wizard will provide suggestions on how to apply for any
                benefit on this website but cannot guarantee eligibility and does not reserve any funding
                or a place in any application queue. The administering agency
                will determine all eligibility requirements upon your submission of an
                application to that agency for the respective program.
              </p>
              <p>
                The information you share for purposes of this Eligibility Wizard will be
                anonymous and may be shared with NJ State agencies to improve access to
                benefits and programs.
