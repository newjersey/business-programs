              <strong>NJEDA Disclaimer for Organization Support Eligibility Wizard</strong>
              <p>
                As a courtesy, the NJEDA is offering this screening tool  (the “Eligibility Wizard”)
                that lists emergency assistance programs that you may decide to consider based
                upon information you provide about your organization.
              </p>
              <p>
                To apply for a program, you need to apply through the appropriate administering
                agency. The Eligibility Wizard will provide suggestions on how to apply for any
                benefit on this website but cannot guarantee eligibility and does not reserve any funding
                or a place in any application queue. The administering agency
                will determine all eligibility requirements upon your submission of an
                application to that agency for the respective program.
              </p>
              <p>
                The information you share for purposes of this Eligibility Wizard will be
                anonymous and may be shared with NJ State agencies to improve access to
                benefits and programs.

                Often one of the most reliable sources of financing for micro, small, and medium-sized
                businesses is their traditional business banking partner.  Many banks in New Jersey work
                with the NJEDA to provide low cost financing to micro, small, and medium-sized enterprises.
                You can contact your local banking branch for more information.
